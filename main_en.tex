    It's unfortunate how undercooked this game is.
    There's clearly a lot of love put into the fan service side of things, especially when it comes to the visuals, but the gameplay is all over the place.
    You'll have moments of ecstasy as you crush weak enemies, but just as many frustrating ones with bad dice rolls and card draws.
    It's a very "Ameritrash" style of game, which I suppose fans of the video game did not expect.
    I wouldn't blame you if you expected to play a Mage Knight lite, but this game just veers far into the opposite direction from Mage Knight's strategic thinky nature.
    \\
    This is a game where, in its current state, the fans have to build it into something greater.
    I hope this rewrite acts as a stepping stone towards that.
