"The following terms are used to describe effects and elements during Combat:"
"\\par \\textbf{Attacking Player} – The player who started the Combat.\\par "
"\\textbf{Defending Player} – The player whom Combat was started against."
"\\par \\textbf{Activation} – A Unit Activates when it is next in the "
"Initiative order.\\par \\textbf{Adjacent Unit} – A Unit is directly adjacent "
"to another if it is one space away in a cardinal direction (nondiagonal)."
"\\par \\textbf{Combat Round} – A full cycle of all Units of each player "
"being Activated.\\par \\textbf{Combat Obstacles}\\index{Combat "
"Obstacles}\\index{Obstacles, Combat} – Every card on the Combat Board is a "
"Combat Obstacle.  They block the movement of all non-flying Units.\\par "
"\\textbf{Attack Die}\\index{Attack Die} – A red Die whose results range from "
"-1 to +1.  Roll the Die \\textbf{whenever a Unit attacks} and add the result "
"to the Unit's Attack value.\\par \\textbf{\\hypertarget{Retaliate}"
"{Retaliation Attack}} – If a Unit survives an attack by an adjacent Unit, it "
"performs an attack back at that Unit.  Each Unit can perform \\textbf{only "
"1} Retaliation Attack\\index{Retaliation Attack} per Combat Round.  "
"Retaliation Attacks function identically to normal attacks, but they cannot "
"cause another Retaliation Attack.  Mark Units which have performed a "
"Retaliation Attack this Round with a black cube.\\par "
"\\textbf{Paralysis}\\index{Paralysis} \\includesvg[height=10px]{\\svgs/"
"paralysis.svg} – Some effects place a Paralysis Token on Units.  That Unit "
"\\textbf{must skip its next Activation}. Remove the Token instead of "
"activating it.  If the Unit \\textbf{attacked or takes any damage} before "
"that time, \\textbf{remove the Token}.  The Token does not prevent Units "
"from performing Retaliation Attacks.\\par \\textbf{\\hypertarget{Defend}"
"{Defend}} \\includesvg[height=10px]{\\svgs/defense.svg} – Units may choose "
"to gain a Defense Token instead of attacking.  When a Unit with a Defense "
"Token is attacked, make another roll with the attack Die after the initial "
"attack roll.  If you roll a \"+1\", the defending Unit gains an extra 1 "
"Defense for this attack.  If a Unit has a Defense Token at the start of its "
