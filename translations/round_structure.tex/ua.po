"The game is structured into Rounds, during which each player will take their own Turn in a clockwise order starting with the starting player.\n"
"During their Turns, players will move their \\hyperlink{Heroes}{Heroes} on the Game Map, construct new Buildings in their \\hyperlink{Town}{Town}, and Recruit \\hyperlink{Units}{Units} in an attempt to fulfill the Scenario's victory condition.\\par\n"

"\\begin{itemize}\n"
"  \\item Flip any previously used Build, Population and/or Spell Book Tokens back to their active side.\n"

"  \\item Regain uses for Expert Effects \\includesvg[height=10px]{\\svgs/expert.svg}.\n"
