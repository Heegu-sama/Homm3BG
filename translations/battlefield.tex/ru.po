"  The Battlefield Expansion introduces the large \\pagelink{Battlefield Combat}{Battlefield Board} and two 1~vs.~1 game modes that focus on tactical combat on the Battlefield Board.\n"
"  Neither of these 2 modes uses the \\pagelink{Map}{Map}.\n"
"  They differ in how players build their Unit and Player Decks:\n"
"  \\smallskip\n"
"  \\begin{itemize}\n"
"    \\item In \\textbf{Adventure Mode}, players experience a card-driven Adventure Phase followed by a final Combat.\n"
"      The Adventure Phase replaces the Map exploration from regular games.\n"
"      During this phase, players use Adventure cards to gather Resources, expand their Town, and develop their Heroes, thereby deciding which units to recruit and which card types to include in their Deck.\n"
"    \\item In \\textbf{Skirmish Mode}, players receive pre-constructed Decks and armies, with minimal control over their composition.\n"
"      Players immediately engage in Combat.\n"

"  \\pagetarget{battlefield card clarifications}{\\subsection*{Rule Ambiguity}}\n"
"  \\textbf{Note:} Both game modes were designed for the \\textbf{Core Game only}.\n"
"  As a result, the official rules do not address many interactions, particularly those involving expansion content.\n"
"  Although these are not official rules, the game developers have provided guidance on these cases:\n"
"  \\begin{itemize}\n"
"    \\item The official rules remove only \\wikilink{abilities/diplomacy}{Diplomacy} and \\wikilink{abilities/logistics}{Logistics} Ability cards, but common sense applies: the developers also recommend removing other Ability cards which provide no benefit in Battlefield modes, like \\wikilink{abilities/ballistics}{Ballistics} or \\wikilink{abilities/pathfinding}{Pathfinding.}\n"
"    \\item In Skirmish Mode, when a card with no Combat value is drawn, both players may mutually agree to discard it and draw a replacement.\n"
"    \\item All cards in the Adventure phase are single-use.\n"
"      Consequently, resource-generating Permanent \\svg[7]{permanent} cards (e.g.,~\\wikilink{artifacts/inexhaustible_cart_of_ore}{Inexhaustible Cart of Ore}) are limited to their bottom \\svg{instant} effect only.\n"
"      However, other Permanent \\svg[7]{permanent} cards (Schools of Magic and War Machines) can be used in the final Combat phase only.\n"
"    \\item Card effects, which instruct you to remove other cards (e.g.,~Expert \\wikilink{abilities/scholar}{Scholar}), may be played during the Adventure phase, applying their effect to your Deck.\n"
"    \\item When a card has both Combat and non-Combat effects (e.g.,~\\wikilink{artifacts/cape_of_velocity}{Cape of Velocity}), you decide whether to use it in the Adventure phase or reserve it for the final Combat.\n"
