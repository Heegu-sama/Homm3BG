"\\textbf{Attacking Player} – The player who started the Combat.\\par\n"
"\\textbf{Defending Player} – The player whom Combat was started against.\\par\n"
"\\textbf{Activation} – A Unit Activates when it is next in the Initiative order.\\par\n"
"\\textbf{Adjacent Unit} – A Unit is directly adjacent to another if it is one space away in a cardinal direction (nondiagonal).\\par\n"
"\\textbf{Combat Round} – A full cycle of all Units of each player being Activated.\\par\n"
"\\textbf{Combat Obstacles}\\index{Combat Obstacles}\\index{Obstacles, Combat} – Every card on the Combat Board is a Combat Obstacle.\n"
"They block the movement of all non-flying Units.\\smallskip\\par\n"

"Roll the Die \\textbf{whenever a Unit attacks} and\n"
"add the result to the Unit's Attack value.}\\par\\smallskip\n"
"\\textbf{\\hypertarget{Retaliate}{Retaliation Attack}} – If a Unit survives an attack by an adjacent Unit, it performs an attack back at that Unit.\n"
"Each Unit can perform \\textbf{only 1} Retaliation Attack\\index{Retaliation Attack} per Combat Round.\n"
