"\\textbf{Attacking Player} – The player who started the Combat.\\par\n"

"Roll the Die \\textbf{whenever a Unit attacks} and\n"
"add the result to the Unit's Attack value.}\\par\\smallskip\n"
"\\textbf{\\hypertarget{Retaliate}{Retaliation Attack}} – If a Unit survives an attack by an adjacent Unit, it performs an attack back at that Unit.\n"
