"    \\item[a)]1 × Double-sided Hero Card (on the side of the chosen Hero)\n"
"    \\item[b)]2 × Hero model\n"
"    \\item[c)]7 × Town Building Tile\n"
"    \\item[d)]1 × Town Board\n"
"    \\item[e)]7 × Double-sided Unit Card\n"
"    \\item[f)]3 × Hero-specific Specialty Card (of the chosen Hero)\n"

"  \\item Set up the Map Tiles and other Scenario-specific components as shown in the Mission Book.\n"
"  \\item Place the Town Board of your chosen Faction in front of you and set the Town Building Tiles next to it.\n"
"    Check which Buildings are already built in the Scenario you are about to play, and place the respective Building Tiles on the Town Board.\n"
"    Resolve any immediate effects from already built Buildings at the end of the setup.\n"
"  \\item Set your starting income as indicated by the Scenario by placing your Faction Cubes on the income trackers on your Town Board.\n"
"    Place the Population, Build, and Spell Book Tokens in their respective slots on the Town Board.\n"
"  \\item Group the Resource Tokens into separate piles located within reach of all players.\n"

"  \\item Add your Hero's \\hyperlink{Ability}{Ability} and Level 1 \\hyperlink{Specialty}{Specialty} Cards to your Starting Deck.\n"
"  \\item Shuffle your Starting Deck and place it face down next to your Hero Card.\n"
"    This Deck is your Main Hero's \\textbf{Deck of Might \\& Magic}\\index{Deck of Might \\& Magic}, and is now ready. In this rule book, this is shortened to \\textbf{Your Deck}.\n"
"  \\item Sort the Ability, Artifact, and Spell Cards into 3 face down Decks (including any unused Magic Arrow Spells) and shuffle them.\n"
"    From each of these Decks, take the top Card and place it face up next to its Deck, creating 3 separate Discard Piles.\n"
"  \\item Choose the Scenario's \\hyperlink{Difficulty}{Difficulty} and take the corresponding Starting Bonus(es).\n"
"  \\item Sort the Neutral Units into 4 Decks according to their tier (\\includesvg[height=10px]{\\svgs/bronze.svg}\\includesvg[height=10px]{\\svgs/silver.svg}\\includesvg[height=10px]{\\svgs/golden.svg}\\includesvg[height=10px]{\\svgs/azure.svg}).\n"
"    Shuffle these Decks and leave enough room for their Discard Piles.\n"
"  \\item Place the Combat Board within reach of the players.\n"
"    Check the Scenario for which starting Units you receive and place them into a pile near your Town Board, separate from the rest of your Faction’s Units.\n"
"  \\item Place the Round Tracker next to the game map and place a Black Cube on the \"1\" space.\n"
"  \\item Shuffle the Astrologers Proclaim Cards and place them face down next to the Round Tracker.\n"
