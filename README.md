# Heroes of Might & Magic III: The Board Game - Rule Book Rewrite Project

Please see the original thread on [Board Game Geek](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3235221/rule-book-rewrite-project/page/1).

### What is this?

This project aims to rewrite the original rulebook, in which the amount of vague language and lack of clearly stated rules was just too vast to ignore.
It is typical for any game to receive fan-made rules summaries or simplified rule sheets.
This repository hosts a document that explains the rules clearly and concisely and eventually has an answer for basically any basic rules query you might have.

### Why?

This is a complex game and that many of the fine points of the rules were still under construction during the Kickstarter campaign.
It is impossible to cover all rule conflicts and player expectations for such a large game.
None of the work here is aimed at causing any discomfort to any Archon staff, or any of the people who wrote, proofread and edited the official rule book.
It is a fan work out of the love of learning games and wanting to understand their complexities.

### How?

The initial strategy was just this: take the whole text body and turn it into proper rule book language.
Rule books should just command players to do stuff.
You MUST move this piece here, but you MAY move it there IF this condition happens.

### The Future

The new rule book and the change log will be published here.
Please open issues with factual errors and any bad language.
You can also open pull requests with suggestions.
