\begin{multicols*}{2}

\hypertarget{End}{All} Scenarios have their victory conditions\index{Victory Conditions} described in the Scenario Book.
In addition, it is always possible to be \textbf{Eliminated} from any Scenario in the following ways:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Play 3 full Rounds without controlling a Town or a Settlement.
    Count the number of Rounds left using any suitable component.
  \item Lose Combat with your \textbf{Main Hero} when you have no Towns or Settlements left, including when defending your last Town or Settlement.
\end{itemize}
Eliminated players are immediately removed from the game.
Discard their Faction Cubes and Hero models from the Game Map.
Treat the cards in their Deck as being Removed from the game for the rest of the Scenario.
If you are Eliminated, you may still participate in the game by controlling Neutral Units.\par
\note{4}{If you Eliminate all enemy Factions, you immediately win the Scenario.}\par

In \textbf{Clash} Scenarios with three or more players, collecting \textbf{a Faction Cube} from every enemy player immediately wins you the game.
Other Scenario specific rules may also modify the outcome of collecting Faction Cubes.

After finishing a \textbf{Solo Campaign} scenario, reset your Hero's Experience Level to 1, and prepare the starting deck for the next scenario of the campaign.
It will consist of:
\begin{itemize}
  \item all the \hyperlink{Statistic}{Statistic} cards from your deck,
  \item the level 1 \hyperlink{Specialty}{Specialty} card,
  \item 5 other non-Specialty cards of your choice from your deck.
\end{itemize}
Skip steps 11-13 of Setup for the next scenario of the campaign.
