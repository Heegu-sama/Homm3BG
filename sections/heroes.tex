\hypertarget{Heroes}{Players} always control a Main Hero and may additionally also recruit a Secondary Hero.
A “player's Hero” may refer to either of them.
Heroes are used to perform Movement Actions on the game board and to start Combats against enemies in order to reach a Scenario victory condition.

\subsection*{Main Hero}
The Main Hero\index{Main Hero} is represented by its chosen model and Hero Card.
Each Faction's Main Hero has 3 Movement Points.
Only the Main Hero can use your Deck.\par
Each Main Hero starts the game at Level 1 and can advance up to Level 7 by gaining Experience.
Experience is gained from \hyperlink{Combatexperience}{winning Combat}, Visiting certain \hyperlink{All}{Locations} and the \hyperlink{Resources}{Treasure Die} \includesvg[height=10px]{\svgs/treasure.svg}.
Gaining 1 Experience\index{Experience} is represented by the symbol \includesvg[height=10px]{\svgs/exp.svg}.

\subsection*{\hypertarget{Secondary}{Secondary Heroes}}
If you control a Town or a Settlement, a Secondary Hero\index{Secondary Hero} can be Hired by flipping your \textbf{Population Token} and paying 10 Gold \includesvg[height=10px]{\svgs/gold.svg}.\par
\note{5}{Units \textbf{cannot} be \hyperlink{Units}{Recruited or Reinforced} while using the Population Token to recruit a Secondary Hero.}\par
Your Secondary Hero uses the remaining Hero model of your Faction.
You may wish to mark this model with a token such as a Faction Cube to differentiate it from the Main Hero.
After Hiring a Secondary Hero, place the model in a Town or Settlement you control.
\textbf{You can only have one Secondary Hero at a time}.\par
Secondary Heroes have 2 Movement Points; when you gain one, take an additional set of 2 Movement Tokens to represent their MP.
They do not have their own Hero Card, cannot gain Experience, and cannot use Cards from Your Deck for any reason.
If a Secondary Hero gains any Cards, \hyperlink{Playerdecks}{place them into your hand} as normal.
Secondary Heroes are considered to have the same Level as the Main Hero for the purposes of resolving \hyperlink{Quick}{Quick Combat}.\par
If your Secondary Hero is attacked by an enemy Hero, you can choose to have your Hero be \hyperlink{Endcombat}{instantly defeated instead of fighting a Combat}.
When a Secondary Hero is defeated, remove them from the game.
They can be Recruited again with another use of the Population Token.\par

\subsection*{\hypertarget{Level}{Level Effects}}
Main Heroes always start each Scenario at Level 1\index{Level} and may Level up by gaining Experience \includesvg[height=10px]{\svgs/exp.svg}.
The most common sources of gaining Experience are the \hyperlink{Resources}{Treasure Die} and \hyperlink{Combatexperience}{Combat}.
Each new Level up requires \textbf{2 Experience}.
When a Main Hero reaches a new Level, resolve the effects of the Level up immediately.
Gaining Experience at Level 7 has no effect.\par
The Level Tracker on your Hero Card shows the following information:
\begin{itemize}
\item Your Main Hero's current Level and amount of Experience gained, shown by the cube's position.
\item Your current Hand Limit \includesvg[height=10px]{\svgs/hand.svg}.
\item The number of \hyperlink{Ability}{Expert Effects} \includesvg[height=10px]{\svgs/expert.svg} you may use during a Round.
\item At which Levels your Main Hero must \hyperlink{Playerdecks}{\textbf{Search}} for a new \hyperlink{Ability}{Ability Card} or gain a \hyperlink{Specialty}{Specialty Card}.
Level numbers written in gold on the Level Tracker (\includesvg[height=10px]{\svgs/level1.svg}, \includesvg[height=10px]{\svgs/level4.svg} and \includesvg[height=10px]{\svgs/level6.svg}) give you a Specialty Card, while silver Levels (2, 3, 5, 7) give you an Ability Card.

List of all effects:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Level 1} – Your Hand Limit\index{Hand Limit} is 4.

\item \textbf{Level 2} – Search (2) the Ability Deck.
You may play 1 Card for its Expert Effect per Round.
\item \textbf{Level 3} – Your Hand Limit is 5.
