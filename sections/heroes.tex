\pagetarget{Heroes}{Players} always control a Main Hero and may additionally also recruit a Secondary Hero.
A ``player's Hero'' may refer to either of them.
Heroes are used to perform Movement Actions on the game board and to start Combats against enemies in order to reach a Scenario victory condition.

\subsection*{Main Hero}
The Main Hero\index{Main Hero} is represented by its chosen model, Hero Card, and Your Deck.
Each Faction's Main Hero has 3 \svgeven{movement}.
Only the Main Hero can use Your Deck.\par
Each Main Hero starts the game at Level 1 and can advance up to Level 7 by gaining Experience.
Experience is gained from \pagelink{Combatexperience}{winning Combat}, Visiting certain \pagelink{All Map Locations}{Locations} and the \pagelink{Treasure Die}{Treasure Die \svg{treasure}}.
Gaining 1 Experience\index{Experience} is represented by the symbol \svg{experience}.

\subsection*{\pagetarget{Secondary}{Secondary Hero}}
If you control a Town or a Settlement, a Secondary Hero\index{Secondary Hero} can be Hired by flipping your \textbf{Population Token} and paying 10 \svg{gold}.\par
\note{5}{Units \textbf{cannot} be \pagelink{Units}{Recruited or Reinforced} while using the Population Token to recruit a Secondary Hero.}\par
Your Secondary Hero uses the remaining Hero model of your Faction.
You may wish to mark this model with a token such as a Faction Cube to differentiate it from the Main Hero.
After Hiring a Secondary Hero, place the model in a Town or Settlement you control.
\textbf{You can only have one Secondary Hero at a time}.\par
Secondary Heroes have \textbf{2 \svgeven{movement}}; when you gain a Secondary Hero, take an additional set of 2 Movement Tokens to represent their MP.
They do not have their own Hero Card, \textbf{cannot gain Experience}, \textbf{cannot play Cards from Your Deck during Combat}, but use \textbf{the same Units} your Main Hero does.
If a Secondary Hero gains any Cards, place them into your hand as normal (see \pagelink{Playerdecks}{Deck-building}).
Secondary Heroes are considered to have the same Level as the Main Hero for the purposes of resolving \pagelink{Quick}{Quick Combat}.\par
If your Secondary Hero is attacked by an enemy Hero, you can choose to have that Hero be \pagelink{Endcombat}{instantly defeated instead of fighting a Combat}.
When a Secondary Hero is defeated, remove them from the game.
They can be Recruited again with another use of the Population Token.\par

\subsection*{\pagetarget{Level}{Level Effects}}
Main Heroes always start each Scenario at Level 1\index{Level} and may Level up by gaining Experience \svg{experience}.
The most common sources of gaining Experience are the \pagelink{Treasure Die}{Treasure Die \svg{treasure}} and \pagelink{Combatexperience}{Combat}.
Each new Level up requires \textbf{2 Experience}.
When a Main Hero reaches a new Level, resolve the effects of the Level up immediately.
Gaining Experience at Level 7 has no effect.\par
The Level Tracker on your Hero Card shows the following information:
\begin{itemize}
\item Your Main Hero's current Level and amount of Experience gained, shown by the cube's position.
\item Your current Hand Limit \svg{hand}.
\item The number of \pagelink{Ability}{Expert Effects} \svgeven{expert} you may use during a Round.
\item At which Levels your Main Hero must \pagelink{Playerdecks}{Search} for a new \pagelink{Ability}{Ability Card} or gain a \pagelink{Specialty}{Specialty Card}.
Level numbers written in gold on the Level Tracker (\svgeven{level1}, \svgeven{level4} and \svgeven{level6}) give you a Specialty Card, while silver Levels (\textbf{II}, \textbf{III}, \textbf{V}, \textbf{VII}) give you an Ability Card.
