\begin{multicols}{2}

The 1~vs.~1 Tournament Mode features rule changes to reduce randomness, allow more tactical decisions, and give players greater control.

\textbf{Note:} Tournament Mode is designed for the Core Game only. Rules for incorporating expansion content (e.g. \pagelink{Sea Map Tiles}{Sea Map Tiles}) are not provided.

\subsection*{Changes during Setup}

Before starting the game, do the following:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Remove the ``Diplomacy'' Ability Card and the ``Hourglass of the Evil Hour'' Artifact Card from the game before building their respective Decks.
  \item Both players roll 2 \svg{resource_die}. The player with the highest total chooses who starts.
  \item The second player gains \svg{morale_positive} at the start of the game.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Building the Map}

The Map in a Tournament Scenario is built by the players and is \textbf{completely revealed} at the start of the game.
The Scenario's Map Layout only shows what the center of the Map should look like and which Tiles are needed to build the rest of the Map.
The placement decisions of all other Map Tiles assigned to the Scenario are decided by both players.

Follow these rules to build the Map and \textbf{always place all Map Tiles face up}:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The starting player places the Map Tiles in the center of the map, matching them to the Scenario's Map Layout, and discovers and rotates them freely.
\columnbreak
  \item Starting with the second player, both players take turns adding the Scenario's Near Map Tiles (if any) to the Map, one at a time.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item If possible, Near Map Tiles must be placed next to a Center Map Tile.
    \item Every Scenario must have at least 2 Near Map Tiles with an Obelisk location on them.
    \item The pool of available Near Map Tiles is facedown. Players draw a random Tile, reveal it, and choose how to place it.
  \end{itemize}
  \item Once all Near Map Tiles have been placed, the first player must place their Starting Map Tile adjacent to at least one Near Map Tile.
    The other player must place their Starting Map Tile on the opposite side of the Map - at the farthest position away from the first player's Starting Map Tile (counted in Tiles).
  \item Starting with the first player, both players take turns adding the Scenario's Far Map Tiles to the Map, one at a time.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Every player's first Far Map Tile must be placed adjacent to their Starting Map Tile.
    \item The remaining Map Tiles must follow the \pagelink{Placing}{standard Tile Placement rules}.
    \item The pool of available Far Map Tiles is facedown. Players draw a random Tile, reveal it, and choose how to place it.
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Additional rules during the game}

The following rules apply to every tournament scenario:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Round One Mulligan:} At the start of the \nth{1} Round, each player may reshuffle their hand of Cards back into their Deck of Might and Magic and draw a new starting hand of Cards once.
  \item All players can use Morale Tokens for a \textbf{new Morale Action}: During \textbf{any Search action}, discard all drawn Cards and perform the Search action again.
  \item If you remove Artifact Cards during the game, \textbf{keep them beside your Deck} until the end of the game, when these Artifact Cards count toward your final Victory Points score.
  \item When Visiting a \textbf{Redwood Observatory}, use its \pagelink{Observatory}{alternative effect}.
  \item \textbf{Optional rule}: You can play with the \pagelink{Split Artifact and Spell Decks}{split Artifact and Spell Decks} variant to have more control over the Cards you draw.
\end{itemize}

\subheader{Scoring Victory Points}
When either the scenario reaches its round limit or any player completes the Scenario's victory condition, the game ends and both players count their Victory Points (VPs) according to the table below.
The player with the most VPs wins the Scenario.
