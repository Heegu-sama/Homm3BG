There are three types of resources in the game: gold, building materials, and valuables.
Resources are spent during the game to expand your town, to recruit units, and to purchase spells.
You can gain resources from settlements and mines that you have \hyperlink{Categories}{flagged}, but also by using artifacts and rolling resource dice \includesvg[height=10px]{\svgs/resource_die.svg}.
Whenever a player's resource production is increased or decreased, move that resource's cube on its production track the appropriate number of spaces.\par
