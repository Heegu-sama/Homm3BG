\addsection{Round Structure}{\images/forgetfulness.png}
The game is structured into Rounds, during which each player will take their own Turn in a clockwise order starting with the starting player.
During their turns, players will move their \hyperlink{Heroes}{Heroes} on the Game Map, construct new Buildings in their \hyperlink{Town}{Town} and Recruit \hyperlink{Units}{Units} in an attempt to fulfill the Scenario's victory condition.\par
Perform the following steps at the start of every Round except the first one:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Flip any previously used Build, Population and/or Spell Book Tokens back to their active side.
  \item Flip any previously used Movement Point (MP) Tokens back to their active, green side.
  \item Regain uses for Expert Effects \includesvg[height=10px]{\svgs/expert.svg}.
\end{itemize}
Then, depending on the current Round number, players either gain Resources or resolve an Astrologers Proclaim card:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Odd-numbered rounds are Resource Rounds.
    All players gain income from the \hyperlink{Mines}{Buildings, Settlements, and Mines} they control.
    Skip this step during the first round.
  \item Even-numbered rounds are Astrologers' Rounds.
    Draw an Astrologers Proclaim card and resolve its effects.
  \item If the Scenario has timed events marked on the round tracker that have now been reached, resolve them.
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Player Actions}
\begin{itemize}
  \item During their turn, players spend their Movement Points (MP) to perform actions with their Heroes.
  \item Build, Population and Spell Book Tokens may be used at any point during any player's turn except during Combat.
  \item Once all players have performed their turn, move the Black Cube on the Round Tracker and perform the start of Round again.
\end{itemize}
Keep playing new Rounds until any of the Scenario's ending conditions have been met.
