A Campaign is a series of Scenarios designed for solo play.

\subsection*{Starting a Scenario}
At the start of each Campaign Scenario, set your income by placing your Faction Cubes on spaces 10~\svg{gold}, 0~\svg{building_materials}, 0~\svg{valuables} of the Resource Production Tracker on the Town board. Special rules in each Scenario can change these values.
Campaigns have unique bonuses that \textbf{replace} the regular starting bonus from the chosen \pagelink{Difficulty}{Difficulty}.

Prepare AI Enemies: their \pagelink{AI Heroes}{units} and their \pagelink{AI Deck}{AI Decks}.

\subsection*{Finishing a Scenario}
After finishing a \textbf{Solo Campaign} Scenario, reset your Hero's Experience Level to I, and prepare the starting Deck for the next Scenario of the Campaign.
It will consist of:
\begin{itemize}
  \item all the \pagelink{Statistic}{Statistic} cards from your Deck,
  \item Level I \pagelink{Specialty}{Specialty} card,
  \item 5 other non-Specialty cards of your choice from your Deck.
\end{itemize}
Skip \pagelink{Setup Starting Deck}{steps 11--13 of Setup} for the next Scenario of the Campaign.

Note down the list of cards in your starting Deck.
If you lose the Scenario, reset the Deck to the same list.

\subsection*{Combat}
See section \pagelink{AI Units}{``Combat against AI''}.

\subsection*{Using different Heroes}
Although each campaign has its own recommended Hero for whom it is balanced and who is also the main character of the story, you are free to play with any other Hero of the same Faction.

If you choose to change your Hero between the Scenarios or when you repeat the scenario with a different Hero,
replace all of the previous Hero’s Statistic cards and the level I Specialty card with all of the Statistic cards and the level I Specialty card of your new Hero.
If the previous Hero had \pagelink{Empowered Statistic}{Empowered Statistics cards},
you can remove Statistic cards of the same type from the new Hero’s deck, and replace them with Empowered Statistic cards of the corresponding type.
You can replace any card in the ``5 other non-Specialty cards'' group with new Hero’s starting Ability card (if you don't already have a copy of that Ability) and \wikilink{spells/magic_arrow}{Magic Arrow(s).}
You cannot have more than 4 \wikilink{spells/magic_arrow}{Magic Arrow} cards.
% TODO if the old hero had 5 magic arrows, do I need to remove one?

\note{6}{If your Hero is at some point given a Spell, Artifact, or Ability card that is unavailable, \textbf{Search (3)} the respective card's Deck to get another card in its stead.}
