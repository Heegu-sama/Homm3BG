  At the start of each Resource Round (except the first Round), draw and read the next Event Card after receiving Resources.
  The first Event is drawn by the starting player.
  \textbf{Change the player who draws the Event in a clockwise order} every time a new Event is drawn.
  Resolve any effects in clockwise order starting with the player who drew the Card.
  Any cards which were revealed as a part of resolving an Event should be shuffled back into their respective Decks afterwards.

  \subsection*{\pagetarget{Creature Banks Rules}{Creature Banks}}
  Playing with Creature Banks is an \textbf{optional rule}.
  If you decide to play with Creature Banks, the following rules apply.

  \bigskip
  \subsection*{Setup}
  Separate the Creature Bank Tokens into two piles (for Near and Far Map Tiles) based on the numerals on their backs.
  Shuffle each pile and place them near the Map.
  Place the Creature Bank Unit Cards face up near the Neutral Unit Decks.
  There is no need to shuffle these Cards.
  Shuffle all Stack Tokens and place them near the Creature Bank Unit Cards.

  \end{multicols*}

  \subsection*{Placing Creature Bank Tokens}
  When you discover a Near or Far Map Tile, you may choose to draw a Creature Bank Token of the corresponding type, and place it on the Tile's Blocked Field.\par

  \subsection*{Visiting a Creature Bank\\Location}
  When you enter a Creature Bank Location, you must defeat the corresponding Creature Bank Units defending it.
  If you win, resolve the Field's effect and mark it with a Black Cube.
  Because these Fields don't have any Difficulty Level, Quick Combat never happens, there is no Round limit, no need to spend MP to extend Combat, and you don't gain any \svg{experience}.
  The defending Units and all effects of all Creature Bank Locations are listed in \pagelink{Creature Bank List}{All Map Locations}.

  \subsection*{Combat in a Creature Bank}
  When you start Combat at a Creature Bank, place up to 5 of your Units in the player deployment zone.
  Depending on the Creature Bank you are visiting, take the corresponding Units from the Creature Bank Unit Cards and place them randomly in the Neutral Unit deployment zone.

  Based on the Scenario's Difficulty Level, take a number of Stack Tokens and place them randomly on up to four different Creature Bank Unit Cards:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Easy}: 1 token
    \item \textbf{Normal}: 2 tokens
    \item \textbf{Hard}: 3 tokens
    \item \textbf{Impossible}: 4 tokens
  \end{itemize}

  \end{multicols*}
\end{expansion}

\begin{multicols*}{2}
\begin{expansion}[before=\vspace*{-11mm}]{navalbattles}
  Each Stack Token modifies a Unit's statistics in the following way: +1~\svg{attack}, +1~\svg{defense}, +1~\svg{health_points}, or +2~\svg{initiative}.
  Furthermore, each Unit with a Stack Token is now a Stacked Unit, which is similar to reinforced Faction Units: Instead of removing the Unit Card from the Combat Board when it takes damage equal to or greater than its HP, discard the Stack Token from that Unit and deal any leftover damage (if any), deducting it from the new HP.
  Creature Bank Units without a Stack Token are defeated normally.
  After Combat, return all Creature Bank Units back to the Creature Bank Units Cards pile.
  If you win, you claim the Creature Bank's reward, as well as an additional reward for every Stacked Unit you defeat.
  Some rewards allow you to gain a Stacked Creature Bank Unit Card.
  When you gain it, draw a random Stack Token and place it on that Unit.
