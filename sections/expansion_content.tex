\pagetarget{Expansion Content}
Numerous expansions have been released for Heroes III: The Board Game, introducing new gameplay elements.
Most expansion rules are integrated directly into the relevant sections of this rulebook where they belong.
Below you'll find an overview of all expansion content.

\textbf{The following contents are added by many of the expansions:}
\begin{multicols*}{2}
\subsection*{New Map Locations}
Each expansion adds new Map Locations to the game, which your Heroes can explore.
They are explained in \pagelink{All Map Locations}{All Map Locations}.

\subsection*{\pagetarget{Miniatures}{Unit Miniatures}}
If you want to play your Combats with Miniatures, place and move them over the Combat Board instead of the Cards.
You can put Miniatures on top of the Cards or keep the Cards next to the Combat Board to form an initiative bar for better visualization of the order in which Units activate.\par
\vspace*{1em}
If you play with Miniatures, there are a few rules to follow:
\begin{itemize}
  \item If any of the following occur during Combat with Neutral Units, discard the Neutral Unit Card and draw another Card in its place:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item if you draw the same Neutral Unit more than once,
      \item if you draw any Unit you already have in your army,
      \item if you draw any Unit from your Faction.
    \end{itemize}
  \item While you Recruit Neutral Units, you cannot Recruit any Units from a Faction that is controlled by a player or any Units that are already in any player's army.
  Discard that Unit Card and draw another.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Permanent Cards}
Cards with a new type of effect which gives players permanent advantages, explained in \pagelink{Playerdecks}{Player Decks}.

\subsection*{Schools of Magic}
\pagelink{Schools of Magic}{Schools of Magic} gain more significance with the expansions, as there are now Card effects which use them, e.g.~your Heroes can specialize in certain Schools to make their Spells more powerful.

\subsection*{Unique Card effects with their own components}
Several new Cards from various expansions come with their own Token components and bring complex effects to the game.
These are all explained in the separate section \pagelink{Detailed Card Effects}{Detailed Card Effects}.

\subsection*{More of the same}
In addition to new gameplay mechanics, expansions also expand the variety of existing components: new Factions, new Scenarios, new Spells, new Heroes, new Artifacts, and new Map Locations.

  Shuffle the Event Deck during setup.
  At the start of each Resource Round (except the first Round), draw and read the next Event Card after receiving Resources.
  The first Event is drawn by the starting player.
  \textbf{Change the player who draws the Event in a clockwise order} every time a new Event is drawn.
  Resolve any effects in clockwise order starting with the player who drew the Card.
  Any Cards which were revealed as a part of resolving an Event should be shuffled back into their respective Decks afterwards.

\begin{multicols*}{2}
  % \subsection*{\pagetarget{Creature Banks Rules}{Creature Banks}}
   Playing with Creature Banks is an \textbf{optional rule}.
   If you decide to play with Creature Banks, the following rules apply.

   \bigskip
   \subsection*{Setup}
   Separate the Creature Bank Tokens into two piles (for Near and Far Map Tiles) based on the numerals on their backs.
   Shuffle each pile and place them near the Map.
   Place the Creature Bank Unit Cards face up near the Neutral Unit Decks.
   There is no need to shuffle these Cards.
   Shuffle all Stack Tokens and place them near the Creature Bank Unit Cards.

        \textbf{\footnotesize\textit{\textcolor{darkcandyapplered}{Creature Bank Unit Card}}}
      \end{center}
    \end{multicols*}

  \subsection*{Placing Creature Bank Tokens}
  When you discover a Near or Far Map Tile, you may choose to draw a Creature Bank Token of the corresponding type, and place it on the Tile's Blocked Field.\par
  \begin{center}
  \vspace*{1em}
    \hspace*{-2em}\transparent{0.2}\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{\art/mermaid.png}
  \end{center}
  \columnbreak

  \subsection*{Visiting a Creature Bank\\Location}
  When you enter a Creature Bank Location, you must defeat the corresponding Creature Bank Units defending it.
  If you win, resolve the Field's effect and mark it with a Black Cube.
  Because these Fields don't have any Difficulty Level, Quick Combat never happens, there is no Round limit, no need to spend MP to extend Combat, and you don't gain any \svg{experience}.
  The defending Units and all effects of all Creature Bank Locations are listed in \pagelink{Creature Bank List}{All Map Locations}.

  \subsection*{Combat in a Creature Bank}
  When you start Combat at a Creature Bank, place up to 5 of your Units in the player deployment zone.
  Depending on the Creature Bank you are visiting, take the corresponding Units from the Creature Bank Unit Cards and place them randomly in the Neutral Unit deployment zone.

  Based on the Scenario's Difficulty Level, take a number of \pagelink{Stack Tokens}{Stack Tokens} and place them randomly on up to four different Creature Bank Unit Cards:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Easy}: 1 token
    \item \textbf{Normal}: 2 tokens
    \item \textbf{Hard}: 3 tokens
    \item \textbf{Impossible}: 4 tokens
  \end{itemize}
  \end{multicols*}
\end{expansion}
\begin{expansion}[before=\vspace*{-11mm}]{navalbattles}
  \begin{multicols*}{2}
  After Combat, return all Creature Bank Units back to the Creature Bank Units Cards pile.
  If you win, you claim the Creature Bank's reward, as well as an additional reward for the Stacked Units you defeated.
  \subsection*{\pagetarget{Stack Tokens}{Stack Tokens}}

    \begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.2\linewidth}
      \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{\images/stack_token.png}
    \end{wrapfigure}
  Each Stack Token modifies a Unit's statistic in the following way: +1~\svg{attack}, +1~\svg{defense}, +1~\svg{health_points}, or +2~\svg{initiative}.
  Furthermore, each Unit with a Stack Token is now a \textbf{Stacked Unit}, which is similar to reinforced Faction Units: when it takes damage equal to or greater than its \svg{health_points}, instead of removing the Unit Card from the Combat Board, discard the Stack Token from that Unit and deal any leftover damage, deducting it from the new \svg{health_points}.
  Creature Bank Units without a Stack Token are defeated normally.
  \columnbreak

  \subsection*{Gained Stacked Units}
  Some rewards allow you to gain a Stacked Creature Bank Unit Card.
  Track which of your Units are Stacked by whatever means is comfortable, e.g.~by remembering it or by placing a Token or Cube on it.
  Whenever your Stacked Unit goes to a Combat, draw a random Stack Token and place it on that Unit.
  After Combat, note whether the Unit is still Stacked (for future Combats), then return the Stack Token to the pile.

\pagetarget{Empowered Ability Token}{\subheader{Empowered Ability Cards}}
\begin{multicols*}{2}
  This new type of Card improves your Hero's Ability Cards and is explained in \pagelink{Empowered Ability}{Deck-building}.

  \setlength\columnsep{1em}
  \begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.2\linewidth}
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{\images/crown-token.png}
  \end{wrapfigure}
  You can gain those Cards by spending \textbf{Empowered Ability Tokens}.
  You can use one of these Tokens at the moment you gain a new Ability Card, regardless of how you obtain it.
  If you use such a Token, discard it, remove the just-gained normal Ability Card from the game, and gain the corresponding Empowered Ability Card in its stead.
  There's only 1 copy of each Empowered Ability Card, so if one player takes a particular Empowered Ability Card, they prevent other players from obtaining it.
  If an Empowered Ability Card isn't available, you can't spend the Empowered Ability Token and must keep it for later turns.

  You can gain Empowered Ability Tokens only in certain Scenarios (e.~g.~``Island of Fire'' from the Naval Battles Mission Book).\\

    The Cards are Offense and Wisdom.
    He chooses Offense and places the other Card on the discard pile.}

  \pagetarget{Battlefield Combat}{\subheader{Combat on the Battlefield Board}}
  \begin{multicols*}{2}
  It is recommended to use the Battlefield Combat Board only for \textbf{Player vs.~Player Combats}, even though it is also possible to use it in Neutral Combats.
  Using the Battlefield Board requires using \pagelink{Miniatures}{Miniatures} instead of Unit Cards.

  \medskip
  \subsection*{Battlefield Board in Neutral\\Combats}
  If you decide to use the Battlefield Board in Combats with Neutral Units, ignore the Round Limit:
  At the end of each Combat Round you may freely decide to Retreat or to gain an additional Combat Round with no need to spend a MP \svg{movement}.
  Be aware, however, that this may significantly extend the playtime.

  \medskip
  \subsection*{\pagetarget{BF Obstacles}{Obstacle Tokens}}
  On the Battlefield Board you place Obstacle Tokens, which are divided into three types:
  Effect, Obstacle and Wall/Gate.
  Unless otherwise stated these Tokens count and work as \pagelink{Combatterminology}{Combat Obstacles}.
  To place Effect Obstacles on the Battlefield Board you'll need the Card which creates the effect, such as the Fire Wall Spell: use the Tokens and put the Card beside the Battlefield as a reminder.
  Effect Obstacles may be entered by Units, if the Card text allows it.

  \subsection*{Rules Changes in Combat Setup}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Place obstacles} – Starting with the attacking player, both players take turns choosing and placing one Obstacle Token on the Battlefield Board until \textbf{all Obstacle Tokens (no Effects yet) are placed}.
    No Obstacle can be adjacent to another Obstacle or to any player's deployment zone.

    {\footnotesize\textbf{\textit{\textcolor{darkcandyapplered}{Obstacles and models placed correctly are marked with the green border, and incorrectly -- with the red one.}}}}
    \item \textbf{Place Units} – Starting from the attacking player, the players choose a deployment zone and take turns placing their Units \textbf{one by one}.
    When the last Unit is placed, the Combat begins.
    Only in Player vs. Player Combats can the players decide to allow placing \textbf{up to 7 Units} (instead of 5).

\newpage
\begin{expansion}{battlefield}
  \begin{multicols*}{2}

    \item \textbf{Siege with Walls and Gate} – During a Siege against a Town with a Citadel, only Walls and Gate Obstacles are placed.
      Place no other Obstacles.

  \end{itemize}
  \subsection*{Rules Changes during Combat}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Unit Movement} – Each Unit's Movement is equal to its Initiative value: a Unit of Initiative 8 can move up to 8 hexes.
    \item \textbf{Ranged movement}  – Ranged \svg{unit_ranged} Units can either move or attack, not both.
    \item \textbf{Combat Penalty} – Ranged \svg{unit_ranged} Units suffer a Combat Penalty when attacking an adjacent Unit or a Unit that is \textbf{8 or more} hexes away from them.

        \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{\images/initiative-bf.png}
      \end{wrapfigure}
      \item \textbf{\pagetarget{Initiative Token}{Initiative Token}} – At the start of Combat, the attacking player gains the Initiative Token.
      Use it only to break any Initiative ties of opposing Units:
      The player with the Token activates first \textbf{one of their Units of the same Initiative value}.
      Then, the players alternate in activating all of their Units of that same Initiative value one by one.
      Once all Units with that Initiative value are activated, pass the Initiative Token to the other player, who keeps it until initiative ties must be resolved again in the same way.
    \end{minipage}

    \item \textbf{Gate Token} – During a Siege, defending Units may enter the Gate Token \textbf{only at the two middle hexes} where the Gate is printed.
    Attacking the Gate Token is still possible on all four hexes.

    \vspace*{1em}
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{\examples/bf-gate-token.png}

 \begin{expansion}{stretchgoals2}
   \subsection*{\pagetarget{Pandora Card}{Pandora's Box Cards}}
   During setup, shuffle the Pandora's Box Cards.
   When you Visit a \pagelink{Pandora Box}{Pandora's Box}, you may optionally draw a Pandora's Box Card and resolve it instead of the location's regular effect.
   You still have to mark the Field with a Black Cube.
