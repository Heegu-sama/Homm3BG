\pagetarget{Expansion Content}
Numerous expansions have been released for Heroes III: The Board Game, introducing new gameplay elements.
Most expansion rules are integrated directly into the relevant sections of this rulebook where they belong.
Below you'll find an overview of all expansion content.

\textbf{The following contents are added by many of the expansions:}
\begin{multicols*}{2}
\subsection*{\pagetarget{Miniatures}{Unit Miniatures}}
If you want to play your Combats with Miniatures, place and move them over the Combat Board instead of the cards.
You can put Miniatures on top of the cards or keep the cards next to the Combat Board to form an initiative bar for better visualization of the order in which units activate.\par
If you play with Miniatures, there are a few rules to follow:
\begin{itemize}
  \item If any of the following occur during Combat with Neutral Units, discard the Neutral Unit card and draw another card in its place:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item if you draw the same Neutral Unit more than once,
      \item if you draw any unit you already have in your army,
      \item if you draw any unit from your Faction.
    \end{itemize}
  \item While you recruit Neutral Units, you cannot recruit any units from a Faction that is controlled by a player or any units that are already in any player's army.
  Discard that unit card and draw another.
\end{itemize}

\end{center}

\subsection*{New Map Locations}
Each expansion adds new Map Locations to the game, which your Heroes can explore.
They are explained in \pagelink{All Map Locations}{All Map Locations}.

\subsection*{Permanent cards}
Cards with a new type of effect which gives players permanent advantages, explained in \pagelink{Playerdecks}{Player Decks}.

\subsection*{Schools of Magic}
\pagelink{Schools of Magic}{Schools of Magic} gain more significance with the expansions, as there are now card effects which use them, e.g.~your Heroes can specialize in certain Schools to make their Spells more powerful.

\subsection*{Unique card effects with their own components}
Several new cards from various expansions come with their own Token components and bring complex effects to the game.
These are all explained in the separate section \pagelink{Card Effect Keywords}{Card Effect Keywords}.

\subsection*{More of the same}
In addition to new gameplay mechanics, expansions also expand the variety of existing components: new Factions, new Scenarios, new Spells, new Heroes, and new Artifacts.

\pagetarget{Creature Banks Rules}{\subheader{Creature Banks}}
\begin{multicols*}{2}
  Playing with Creature Banks is an \textbf{optional rule}.
  If you decide to play with Creature Banks, the following rules apply.

  \subsection*{Setup}
  Separate the Creature Bank Tokens into two piles (for Near and Far Map Tiles) based on the numerals on their backs.
  Shuffle each pile and place them near the Map.
  Place the Creature Bank unit cards face up near the Neutral Unit Decks.
  There is no need to shuffle these cards.
  Shuffle all Stack Tokens and place them near the Creature Bank unit cards.

      \end{tikzpicture}\\
      \imagecaption{Creature Bank unit card}
    \end{center}
  \end{minipage}

  \subsection*{Placing Creature Bank Tokens}
  When you discover a Near or Far Map Tile, you may choose to draw a Creature Bank Token of the corresponding type, and place it on the Tile's Blocked Field.

  \subsection*{Visiting a Creature Bank\\Location}
  When you enter a Creature Bank Location, you must defeat the corresponding Creature Bank units defending it.
  If you win, resolve the Field's effect and mark it with a Black Cube.
  Because these Fields don't have any Difficulty Level, Quick Combat never happens, there is no Round limit, no need to spend MP to extend Combat, and you don't gain any \svg{experience}.
  The defending units and all effects of all Creature Bank Locations are listed in \pagelink{Creature Bank List}{All Map Locations}.

  \subsection*{Combat in a Creature Bank}
  When you start Combat at a Creature Bank, place up to 5 of your units in the player deployment zone.
  Depending on the Creature Bank you are visiting, take the corresponding units from the Creature Bank unit cards and place them randomly in the Neutral unit deployment zone.

  Based on the Scenario's Difficulty Level, take a number of \pagelink{Stack Tokens}{Stack Tokens} and place them randomly on up to four different Creature Bank unit cards:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Easy}: 1 token
    \item \textbf{Normal}: 2 tokens
    \item \textbf{Hard}: 3 tokens
    \item \textbf{Impossible}: 4 tokens
  \end{itemize}
  \end{multicols*}
\end{expansion}

\clearpage
\begin{multicols*}{2}
\begin{expansion}{navalbattles}
  After Combat, return all Creature Bank units back to the Creature Bank units cards pile.
  If you win, you claim the Creature Bank's reward, as well as an additional reward for the Stacked units you defeated.

    \begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.2\linewidth}

  Each Stack Token modifies a unit's statistic in the following way: +1~\svg{attack}, +1~\svg{defense}, +1~\svg{health_points}, or +2~\svg{initiative}.
  Furthermore, each unit with a Stack Token is now a \textbf{Stacked unit}, which is similar to reinforced Faction units: when it takes damage equal to or greater than its \svg{health_points}, instead of removing the unit card from the Combat Board, discard the Stack Token from that unit and deal any leftover damage, deducting it from the new \svg{health_points}.
  Creature Bank units without a Stack Token are defeated normally.

    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{\images/stack-token-ini.png}
  \end{multicols}

  \subsection*{Gained Stacked Units}
  Some rewards allow you to gain a Stacked Creature Bank unit card.
  Track which of your units are Stacked by whatever means is comfortable, e.g.~by remembering it or by placing a Token or Cube on it.
  Whenever your Stacked unit goes to a Combat, draw a random Stack Token and place it on that unit.
  After Combat, note whether the unit is still Stacked (for future Combats), then return the Stack Token to the pile.

\pagetarget{Empowered Ability Token}{\subheader{Empowered Ability Cards}}
\begin{multicols*}{2}
  This new type of card improves your Hero's Ability cards and is explained in \pagelink{Empowered Ability}{Deck-building}.

  \setlength\columnsep{1em}
  \begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.2\linewidth}
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{\images/crown-token.png}
  \end{wrapfigure}
  You can gain those cards by spending \textbf{Empowered Ability Tokens}.
  You can use one of these Tokens at the moment you gain a new Ability card, regardless of how you obtain it.
  If you use such a Token, discard it, remove the just-gained normal Ability card from the game, and gain the corresponding Empowered Ability card in its stead.
  There's only 1 copy of each Empowered Ability card, so if one player takes a particular Empowered Ability card, they prevent other players from obtaining it.
  If an Empowered Ability card isn't available, you can't spend the Empowered Ability Token and must keep it for later turns.

  You can gain Empowered Ability Tokens only in certain Scenarios (e.~g.~``Island of Fire'' from the Naval Battles Mission Book).\\

    He chooses Offense and places the other card on the discard pile.}

  Here are some recommended options how to do that:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Shuffle the Deck and deal 2 Town cards to each player.
      Each player then chooses their Faction from these cards.
      If you do not own enough Expansions, deal 1 card to each person instead.
    \item
      Shuffle the Deck and deal 2 Town cards to the first player.
      The first player chooses one card and passes the other one to the next player.
      The next player draws 1 more Town card from the Deck, selects one card from the two, and passes the other card to the next person.
      Repeat this until every player has chosen their Faction.

  Skip the cards with Factions from Expansions which you don't have.
