\subsection*{\hypertarget{Playerdecks}{Player decks}}
All players have a unique deck which represents their main hero's abilities and equipment. Decks may contain statistic cards, ability cards, spell cards, artifact cards and the chosen hero’s specialty cards. Each player’s deck starts with 9 cards, built during the game’s set up. Game components may refer to this deck as your \textbf{Deck of Might and Magic}, in this rule book this is shorthanded to \textit{your deck}.
\subsection*{General card rules}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Cards can be played \textbf{only on your turn}, or in a combat involving your \textbf{main hero}.
  \item After a card is used, discard it. Each player has their own separate discard pile for their own deck.
  \item If your deck is empty when you need to draw a card, shuffle your discard pile into a new deck to draw from.
  \item Whenever a hero gains a card for any reason, put it directly into your hand unless otherwise stated.
  \item Whenever you are instructed to \textbf{search} (X) the ability, artifact, or spell deck, you may either look at the top (X) cards from the specified deck, take one of them to your hand, and discard the others, or-instead of looking at the top (X) cards add the top card from that deck’s discard pile to your hand.
  \item The ability, artifact, and spell decks each have their own discard piles, created during the setup, which help players identify these decks. If a deck ever runs out of cards, reshuffle it and discard its top card to form a new discard pile. Also, whenever an ability, artifact or spell deck discard is empty, refill it with that deck’s top card.
  \item Player cards have the following types of effects:
  \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Instant} \includesvg[height=10px]{\svgs/instant.svg} effects are resolved immediately and can be played out of turn during combat.
        \item \textbf{Activation} \includesvg[height=10px]{\svgs/activation.svg} effects must be played when activating your own unit in combat.
        \item \textbf{Map} \includesvg[height=10px]{\svgs/map.svg} effects cannot be used during combat.
        \item \textbf{Ongoing} \includesvg[height=10px]{\svgs/ongoing.svg} effects last until they are used up or until the player who played them starts their next turn (whichever happens first).
        \item \textbf{Permanent} \includesvg[height=10px]{\svgs/permanent.svg} cards stay in your play area until discarded or replaced. \textbf{Players may have only one permanent card at a time}; playing another discards the first.
    \end{itemize}

\end{enumerate}

Every ability and statistic card has a basic effect and a stronger expert effect, which is shown below the basic effect. Whenever a player plays an ability or statistic card, they must choose which effect they are using. The number of expert \includesvg[height=10px]{\svgs/expert.svg} effects a player can use each round is limited by their main hero’s \hyperlink{Level}{level}. Track the number of uses each player has in any suitable manner, such as by moving black cubes on and off your hero card.\par
\textbf{Important}: Certain cards are limited to the Necropolis faction \includesvg[height=10px]{\svgs/necro.svg}. When a non-Necropolis player draws one, they may either discard it and draw a new card as a replacement or gain it as normal. Non-Necropolis players cannot use faction specific cards from their hand in any way besides discarding them.

\subsection*{Artifact cards}
Artifact cards are divided into 3 levels: minor, major, and relic. These levels relate to the overall power of the card and may be referenced when resolving certain effects or during scenario set up. Artifacts are gained through map exploration.\par
Artifacts can be \hyperlink{Trading}{traded} in alliance and cooperative scenarios.\par

Spell cards have three possible primary effects. Using the topmost basic version of the spell has no additional costs. Accessing the second and third effects requires the spell to be \textbf{empowered} before it is played. The amount a spell needs to be empowered for each effect is indicated within a circle in the middle of its card text.\par
You may empower a spell by playing any card for its empower \includesvg[height=10px]{\svgs/empower.svg} effect. The bottom, alternative effect of all spell cards is to empower another spell.\par
\textbf{Important}: During combat, \textbf{only one spell} card may be played by each player \textbf{per combat round}.\par
Spells can be gained by building the mage guild. When you do, search (2) the spell deck, twice. If you start a scenario with the mage guild, perform the searching in turn order and shuffle the cards into your deck at the end of the set up. More spells can be bought by flipping your spell book token and paying the indicated cost on the guild to search (2) the spell deck. This cannot be done during the same round as when the guild is constructed. Spells can be \hyperlink{Trading}{traded} in alliance and cooperative scenarios.

\subsection*{\hypertarget{Specialty}{Hero specialty cards}}
Hero specialty cards are gained from level ups. Each hero has an unique set of them. While many specialty cards have effects which resemble spell cards, specialty cards are their \textbf{own unique category of card}, which are not affected by effects that do not specify them.
