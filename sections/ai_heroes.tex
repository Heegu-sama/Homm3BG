  \subsection*{AI Hero Turn}
  \hypertarget{AIrules}{AI Heroes} are used in the Campaigns.
  They start in their Town, and have 3 MP, always spending them to perform the following Actions in descending priority:
}
\pl{}
\begin{itemize}
  \en{\item If a player's Hero is on the same Tile as the AI, spend all MP to move towards them in an attempt to start Combat.}
  \pl{\item}
  \en{\item If there are any Mines or Settlements the AI could Flag on the same Tile, move towards the closest one.}
  \pl{\item}
  \en{
    \item Otherwise, move toward the player's Town.
      Repeat this sequence until all MPs are used up.
      AI Heroes take their turn after the player.
  }
  \pl{\item}
\end{itemize}

\en{
  AI Heroes always \textbf{automatically win Combat} against any Neutral Units, while simultaneously \textbf{Flagging or Visiting all Fields} they happen to move through.
  They gain no benefits from any Fields.
}
\pl{}

\en{
  AI Heroes must discover face down Map Tiles as normal by spending 1 MP before moving onto them.
  The player chooses that Tile's orientation.\par
  AI Heroes cannot Surrender and you cannot Surrender to them;
  they will always fight until they run out of Units.
  Winning Combat against an AI Hero does not grant any rewards unless stated by the Scenario.
  AI Heroes do not have a Town Board, Resources, or a Hero Card.
  Their Units are static and defined by the Scenario's setup or other rules.\par
  Any differences to the above will be described in any given Scenario's own rules.

  \subsection*{AI Decks}
  AI Heroes use two automated Decks during Combat: the \textbf{AI Deck}, and the \textbf{Spell Deck}.
  The AI Deck is built using three types of AI cards: Might \includesvg[height=10px]{\svgs/might.svg}, Magic \includesvg[height=10px]{\svgs/magic.svg} and Skill \includesvg[height=10px]{\svgs/skill.svg}.
  Each Campaign scenario lists the number of each type of Card included in the AI Deck.
  Might \includesvg[height=10px]{\svgs/might.svg} and Skill \includesvg[height=10px]{\svgs/skill.svg} Cards have two variations. Choose these cards \textbf{randomly} when building the Deck.
  If Skill Cards are included, search for and set aside the Ability Card related to it.
  Build the AI's \textbf{Spell Deck} by separating the indicated Spells from the regular Spell Deck.
  Shuffle the AI and Spell Decks during setup after building them.\par
  When an AI Hero \textbf{Activates} a Unit, draw an AI Card\index{AI Card} and follow its instructions before the Unit moves and/or attacks.
  The effect of each AI card depends of the game's \hyperlink{Difficulty}{Difficulty}.
  The AI Spell Deck is used whenever a Magic Card \includesvg[height=10px]{\svgs/magic.svg} is drawn.
  If an AI Hero is instructed to draw a card, they will draw and resolve \textbf{another card} from the AI Deck.

  \subsection*{Combat against AI}
  These rules apply during Combat in \textbf{Solo}\index{Solo Mode} and \textbf{Cooperative} Scenarios.
  When Neutral enemies or AI Heroes activate a unit, they follow a set of automatic instructions:\par
}
\pl{}

\en{
  Enemy Ground \includesvg[height=10px]{\svgs/unit_ground.svg} and Flying \includesvg[height=10px]{\svgs/unit_flying.svg} Units prioritize attacking Units of the same tier.
  If this is impossible, they attack the closest Unit, prioritizing the lowest tier one.\par
  Ranged \includesvg[height=10px]{\svgs/unit_ranged.svg} Units prioritize attacking other Ranged \includesvg[height=10px]{\svgs/unit_ranged.svg} Units of the same tier, then lower tier, and finally higher tier.
  If there are no Ranged \includesvg[height=10px]{\svgs/unit_ranged.svg} Units for them to target, they prioritize Ground \includesvg[height=10px]{\svgs/unit_ground.svg} and Flying \includesvg[height=10px]{\svgs/unit_flying.svg} Units in the same tier order.
  If there's more than one valid target, they attack the closest one.\par
  If there's ever a tie between equally valid targets for any Units, the player chooses which Unit is attacked.
  Enemy units cannot \hyperlink{Defend}{Defend} unless instructed to.
