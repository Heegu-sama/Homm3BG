Each game of Heroes III is played using a Scenario from the Mission Book.\par 
The core game only allows you to choose scenarios for 1-3 players. For 4 or more players, expansions are required.\par
In addition to the scenario objectives, read the \pagelink{Scenario end}{general victory conditions} depending on the scenario type.

\subsection*{Clash}
A fully competitive mode. The opponent to your right \pagelink{combat}{controls} neutral enemy units.

\subsection*{Campaign}
A single player mode\index{Solo Mode} of interconnected Scenarios against an enemy AI.
To control the enemy units, follow \pagelink{AIrules}{the AI rules}.
Further rules changes are detailed in the Campaign Mission Books.

\subsection*{Alliance}
