Each game of Heroes III is played using a \textbf{Scenario} from the Mission Book.
The core game only allows you to choose Scenarios for 1-3 players. For 4 or more players, expansions are required.\par
In addition to the Scenario objectives, read the \pagelink{End}{general victory conditions} depending on the Scenario type.\par
There are several types of Scenarios:

\subsection*{Clash}
A fully competitive mode.
Your opponents control Neutral Units in your Combat.

\subsection*{Campaign}
A single player mode\index{Solo Mode} of interconnected Scenarios against an enemy AI.
For rules unique to Solo Mode, see \pagelink{AIrules}{the AI rules}.
Further rules changes are detailed in the Campaign Mission Books.

\subsection*{Alliance}
Usually a 2 vs.~2 team-based mode with expanded opportunities to \pagelink{Trading}{trade} between allied players.

\subsection*{Cooperative}
A Cooperative mode where everyone shares the same goal. \pagelink{AI Units}{The AI rules} and expanded \pagelink{Trading}{Trading rules} apply here.

\subsection*{Tournament}
A 1 vs.~1 mode with different way of building Map and scoring. See \pagelink{Tournament Mode}{Tournament rules}.
