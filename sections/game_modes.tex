Each game of Heroes III is played using a Scenario from the Mission Book.
There are several types of Scenarios:

\subsection*{Clash}
A fully competitive mode for 2--3 players.

\subsection*{Campaign}
A single player mode of interconnected Scenarios against an enemy AI.
For rules unique to Solo Mode\index{Solo Mode}, see \pagelink{AIrules}{the AI rules} and \pagelink{End}{Scenario end}.
Further rules changes are detailed in the Campaign Mission Books.

\subsection*{Alliance}
A 2 vs.~2 team-based mode.
You will need an expansion pack to play a 4-player game.

\subsection*{Cooperative}
A Cooperative mode for 2--3 players where everyone shares the same goal.

\subsection*{Tournament}
A 1 vs.~1 mode with different way of building map and scoring. See the Tournament Book.

\subsection*{Battlefield expansion}
The expansion adds two more 1 vs.~1 modes, without using Scenarios: Adventure, Skirmish. See the Battlefield expansion's rulebook.

\subsubsection*{Adventure}
The map exploration is replaced with Adventure cards. It ends with a battle on a big battlefield.
